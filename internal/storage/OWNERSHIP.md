# Repository ownership boundaries

Authenticated handlers must use repository methods that accept `userID` or a
`ForUser` suffix and enforce ownership in SQL. A preceding handler check is not
a substitute for a constrained mutation when a user-scoped repository method
can perform the operation atomically.

## Browser-safe boundaries

The browser-facing handler layer uses these ownership shapes:

- Messages, threads, bodies, fetch information, remote content, and
  attachments join through `accounts.user_id` and exclude deleting accounts.
- Accounts and folders are loaded from `GetAccounts*`, `GetAccountIDs`,
  `GetEmailSyncAccountIDs`, `ResolveFolderIDForUser`, or the account store's
  `GetAccountByIDForUser`.
- Account sending identities and suggestions carry `userID` and join through
  `accounts.user_id` (`ListAccountIdentities`, `AddManualIdentity`,
  `DeleteIdentity`, `SetDefaultIdentity`, `IdentityForAccount`,
  `IdentitySuggestions*`, `DismissIdentitySuggestion`).
- Contacts, contact profiles/cards/fields, signatures, settings, suppressed
  contacts, and Web Push subscriptions carry `userID` directly.
- Draft, outgoing-send, and mail-operation HTTP reads and retries use their
  `ForUser` variants or begin with an owned message/account lookup.
- Avatar delivery uses `GetSenderAvatarByHashForUser`,
  `IsSenderAvatarEmailVisibleToUser`, or
  `IsProviderAvatarURLVisibleToUser`. Global avatar-cache methods are not
  browser authorization boundaries.

## Trusted unscoped worker boundaries

These methods intentionally have no browser user argument. Their callers and
preconditions are part of their contract:

- `ClaimDueOutgoingSends` and `ClaimDueSentCopies`: outgoing and sent-copy
  workers only. Queue creation/retry is user-scoped; claims exclude deleting
  accounts and accounts whose user is not active.
- `ClaimDueMessageMutations`: message-mutation worker only. Authenticated
  enqueue methods validate all targets first; claims exclude deleting accounts
  and accounts whose user is not active.
- `ClaimDueIMAPDraftOperations`: IMAP draft worker only. Draft handlers first
  establish message/account ownership; claims exclude deleting accounts and
  accounts whose user is not active.
- `ClaimContactSyncOperations`: contact-sync worker only. The worker re-reads
  the current user-owned contact and current target accounts before provider
  traffic; claims require the operation's user to remain active.
- `ListDueLabelMutations`: provider sync worker only. `accountID` comes from an
  active account sync path enumerated by `GetAllEmailSyncAccountIDs`, which
  excludes deleting accounts and accounts whose user is not active. Label
  replay independently checks the same conditions.
- `ApplyProviderIdentities`, `IdentitiesSyncedAt`, `TouchIdentitiesSyncedAt`:
  Gmail sync path only; `accountID` comes from an active account sync or from a
  handler that first established ownership.
- Queue completion, retry-state, provider UID, folder-state, body persistence,
  and attachment persistence methods are called only after one of the claims
  above or after an owned/account-scoped provider sync has established the
  account and message identity.
- Methods whose names end in `Internal` are trusted continuations only. They
  include global message lookups, draft/provider resolution, mutation and
  outgoing-send reads, and body, recipient, and attachment persistence.
  Browser handlers must begin with the matching `ForUser` lookup or an owned
  account and must not pass a request-supplied global ID directly into an
  `Internal` method.
- `GetAllAccountIDs` and `GetAllEmailSyncAccountIDs` are startup/background
  enumerators for active users. They are not valid sources for a browser
  response.
- Global avatar candidate/cache methods are used by avatar warmup/backfill and
  administrator diagnostics. User delivery is separately authorization
  checked.
- Global mail-operation, avatar, contact, label, retention, threading, and
  security-exception diagnostics are administrator-only and expose operational
  metadata rather than private message content.

When a new unscoped method is introduced, its name must make the internal trust
boundary explicit and it must be added here with its exact trusted caller and
the ownership check that occurs before any side effect.
